RoB2 - 1.3 - Did baseline differences between intervention groups suggest a problem with the randomization process?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that differences that are compatible with chance do not lead to a risk of bias. A small number of differences identified as ‘statistically significant’ at the conventional 0.05 threshold should usually be considered to be compatible with chance.

- Answer ‘No’ if no imbalances are apparent or if any observed imbalances are compatible with chance.

- Answer ‘Yes’ if there are imbalances that indicate problems with the randomization process, including:
(1) substantial differences between intervention group sizes, compared with the intended allocation ratio;
or
(2) a substantial excess in statistically significant differences in baseline characteristics between intervention groups, beyond that expected by chance; or
(3) imbalance in one or more key prognostic factors, or baseline measures of outcome variables, that is very unlikely to be due to chance and for which the between-group difference is big enough to result in bias in the intervention effect estimate.

Also answer ‘Yes’ if there are other reasons to suspect that the randomization process was problematic:
(4) excessive similarity in baseline characteristics that is not compatible with chance.

- Answer ‘No information’ when there is no useful baseline information available (e.g. abstracts, or studies that reported only baseline characteristics of participants in the final analysis).

The answer to this question should not influence answers to questions 1.1 or 1.2. For example, if the trial has large baseline imbalances, but authors report adequate randomization methods, questions 1.1 and 1.2 should still be answered on the basis of the reported adequate methods, and any concerns about the imbalance should be raised in the answer to the question 1.3 and reflected in the domain-level risk-of-bias judgement.

Trialists may undertake analyses that attempt to deal with flawed randomization by controlling for imbalances in prognostic factors at baseline. To remove the risk of bias caused by problems in the randomization process, it would be necessary to know, and measure, all the prognostic factors that were imbalanced at baseline. It is unlikely that all important prognostic factors are known and measured, so such analyses will at best reduce the risk of bias. If review authors wish to assess the risk of bias in a trial that controlled for baseline imbalances in order to mitigate failures of randomization, the study should be assessed using the ROBINS-I tool.
