ROB2 - 2.3 - If Y/PY/NI to 2.1 or 2.2 - Were there deviations from the intended intervention that arose because of the trial context?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

For the effect of assignment to intervention, this domain assesses problems that arise when changes from assigned intervention that are inconsistent with the trial protocol arose because of the trial context. We use the term trial context to refer to effects of recruitment and engagement activities on trial participants and when trial personnel (carers or people delivering the interventions) undermine the implementation of the trial protocol in ways that would not happen outside the trial. For example, the process of securing informed consent may lead participants subsequently assigned to the comparator group to feel unlucky and therefore seek the experimental intervention, or other interventions that improve their prognosis.

- Answer ‘Yes’ or ‘Probably yes’ only if there is evidence, or strong reason to believe, that the trial context led to failure to implement the protocol interventions or to implementation of interventions not allowed by the protocol. 

- Answer ‘No’ or ‘Probably no’ if there were changes from assigned intervention that are inconsistent with the trial protocol, such as non-adherence to intervention, but these are consistent with what could occur outside the trial context. 
Answer ‘No’ or ‘Probably no’ for changes to intervention that are consistent with the trial protocol, for example cessation of a drug intervention because of acute toxicity or use of additional interventions whose aim is to treat consequences of one of the intended interventions.

- If blinding is compromised because participants report side effects or toxicities that are specific to one of the interventions, answer ‘Yes’ or ‘Probably yes’ only if there were changes from assigned intervention that are inconsistent with the trial protocol and arose because of the trial context.  
The answer ‘No information’ may be appropriate, because trialists do not always report whether deviations arose because of the trial context.
