RoB2 - 1.1 - Was the allocation sequence random?
------------------------------------------------

- Answer ‘Yes’ if a random component was used in the sequence generation process. Examples include computer-generated random numbers; reference to a random number table; coin tossing; shuffling cards or envelopes; throwing dice; or drawing lots. Minimization is generally implemented with a random element (at least when the scores are equal), so an allocation sequence that is generated using minimization should generally be considered to be random.

- Answer ‘No’ if no random element was used in generating the allocation sequence or the sequence is predictable. Examples include alternation; methods based on dates (of birth or admission); patient record numbers; allocation decisions made by clinicians or participants; allocation based on the availability of the intervention; or any other systematic or haphazard method.

- Answer ‘No information’ if the only information about randomization methods is a statement that the study is randomized.

- In some situations a judgement may be made to answer ‘Probably no’ or ‘Probably yes’. For example, , in the context of a large trial run by an experienced clinical trials unit, absence of specific information about generation of the randomization sequence, in a paper published in a journal with rigorously enforced word count limits, is likely to result in a response of ‘Probably yes’ rather than ‘No information’. Alternatively, if other (contemporary) trials by the same investigator team have clearly used non-random sequences, it might be reasonable to assume that the current study was done using similar methods.
