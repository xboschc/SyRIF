RoB2 - 1.1 - Was the allocation sequence random?
------------------------------------------------

INDIVIDUALLY RANDOMISED TRIALS

- Answer ‘Yes’ if a random component was used in the sequence generation process. Examples include computer-generated random numbers; reference to a random number table; coin tossing; shuffling cards or envelopes; throwing dice; or drawing lots. Minimization is generally implemented with a random element (at least when the scores are equal), so an allocation sequence that is generated using minimization should generally be considered to be random.

- Answer ‘No’ if no random element was used in generating the allocation sequence or the sequence is predictable. Examples include alternation; methods based on dates (of birth or admission); patient record numbers; allocation decisions made by clinicians or participants; allocation based on the availability of the intervention; or any other systematic or haphazard method.

- Answer ‘No information’ if the only information about randomization methods is a statement that the study is randomized.

- In some situations a judgement may be made to answer ‘Probably no’ or ‘Probably yes’. For example, , in the context of a large trial run by an experienced clinical trials unit, absence of specific information about generation of the randomization sequence, in a paper published in a journal with rigorously enforced word count limits, is likely to result in a response of ‘Probably yes’ rather than ‘No information’. Alternatively, if other (contemporary) trials by the same investigator team have clearly used non-random sequences, it might be reasonable to assume that the current study was done using similar methods.

CLUSTER RANDOMISED TRIALS

Considerations are mostly the same as for individually randomized trials. Answer ‘No’ for non-random methods that might be seen in cluster-randomized trials, including those based on geography (e.g. clusters near the main research centre allocated to the intervention and those further away to the control).
