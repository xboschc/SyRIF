RoB2 - 1a.1 - Were all the individual participants identified and recruited (if appropriate) before randomization of clusters?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Answer ‘Yes’ if:
(1) all participants were identified and recruited before the clusters were randomized;
or
(2) individual participants were not recruited at all but all were identified before randomization.

In these cases identification/recruitment bias is not possible.

Answer ‘No’ if:
(1) some or all participants were identified or recruited after randomization;
or
(2) there are any clusters in which no participants were recruited (empty clusters).
