RoB2 - 1.b3 - Were there baseline imbalances that suggest differential identification or recruitment of individual participants between intervention groups?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As for signalling question 1a.3, imbalances that are compatible with chance should not be interpreted as suggesting differential identification or recruitment of participants. Such imbalances are more common in cluster-randomized trials than imbalances due to problems with randomization. They can be in the numbers of participants recruited into each group or in the characteristics of such individuals.
