RoB2 - 2.1b - Were participants aware of their assigned intervention during the trial?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Answer ‘Yes’ if participants were aware of any part of the assigned intervention during the trial. It is important to consider all parts of the assigned intervention. Note that, for the purposes of the risk of bias tool, participants are defined as those on whom investigators seek to measure the outcome under consideration, and may be patients, the public, health professionals or other cluster staff.
