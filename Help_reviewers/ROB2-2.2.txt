RoB2 - 2.2 - Were carers and people delivering the interventions aware of participants' assigned intervention during the trial?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If carers or people delivering the interventions are aware of the assigned intervention then its implementation, or administration of non-protocol interventions, may differ between the intervention groups. Blinding may prevent such differences. If participants experienced side effects or toxicities that carers or people delivering the interventions knew to be specific to one of the interventions, answer question ‘Yes’ or ‘Probably yes’. If randomized allocation was not concealed, then it is likely that carers and people delivering the interventions were aware of participants' assigned intervention during the trial.
