ROB2 - 2.3 - Adherence - Were important non-protocol interventions balanced across intervention groups?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

INDIVIDUALLY RANDOMISED TRIALS

This question is asked only if the preliminary considerations specify that the assessment will address imbalance of important non-protocol interventions between intervention groups. Important non-protocol interventions are the additional interventions or exposures that:

(1) are inconsistent with the trial protocol;
(2) trial participants might receive with or after starting their assigned intervention; and
(3) are prognostic for the outcome. Risk of bias will be higher if there is imbalance in such interventions between the intervention groups.

CLUSTER RANDOMISED TRIALS

Mostly as for individually-randomized trials. It is important to consider co-interventions at both the individual and cluster level.
