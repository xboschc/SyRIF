ROB2 - 2.3 - Adherence - Were important non-protocol interventions balanced across intervention groups?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

This question is asked only if the preliminary considerations specify that the assessment will address imbalance of important non-protocol interventions between intervention groups. Important non-protocol interventions are the additional interventions or exposures that:

(1) are inconsistent with the trial protocol;
(2) trial participants might receive with or after starting their assigned intervention; and
(3) are prognostic for the outcome. Risk of bias will be higher if there is imbalance in such interventions between the intervention groups.
