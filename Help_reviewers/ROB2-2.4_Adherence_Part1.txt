ROB2 - 2.4 - Adherence - Were there failures in implementing the intervention that could have affected the outcome?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This question is asked only if the preliminary considerations specify that the assessment will address failures in implementing the intervention that could have affected the outcome. Risk of bias will be higher if the intervention was not implemented as intended by, for example, the health care professionals delivering care.

Answer ‘No’ or ‘Probably no’ if implementation of the intervention was successful for most participants.
