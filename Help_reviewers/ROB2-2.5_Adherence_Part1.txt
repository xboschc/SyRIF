ROB2 - 2.5 - Adherence - Was there non-adherence to the assigned intervention regimen that could have affected participants’ outcomes?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This question is asked only if the preliminary considerations specify that the assessment will address non-adherence that could have affected participants’ outcomes. Non-adherence includes imperfect compliance with a sustained intervention, cessation of intervention, crossovers to the comparator intervention and switches to another active intervention.

Consider available information on the proportion of study participants who continued with their assigned intervention throughout follow up, and answer ‘Yes’ or ‘Probably yes’ if the proportion who did not adhere is high enough to raise concerns.

Answer ‘No’ for studies of interventions that are administered once, so that imperfect adherence is not possible, and all or most participants received the assigned intervention.
