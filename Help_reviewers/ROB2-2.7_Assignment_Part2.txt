RoB2 - 2.7 - Adherence - Was there potential for a substantial impact (on the result) of the failure to analyse participants in the group to which they were randomized?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This question addresses whether the number of participants who were analysed in the wrong intervention group, or excluded from the analysis, was sufficient that there could have been a substantial impact on the result. It is not possible to specify a precise rule: there may be potential for substantial impact even if fewer than 5% of participants were analysed in the wrong group or excluded, if the outcome is rare or if exclusions are strongly related to prognostic factors.
