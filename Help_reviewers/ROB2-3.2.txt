RoB2 - 3.2 - Is there evidence that the result was not biased by missing outcome data? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Evidence that the result was not biased by missing outcome data may come from: (1) analysis methods that correct for bias; or (2) sensitivity analyses showing that results are little changed under a range of plausible assumptions about the relationship between missingness in the outcome and its true value. However, imputing the outcome variable, either through methods such as ‘last-observation-carried-forward’ or via multiple imputation based only on intervention group, should not be assumed to correct for bias due to missing outcome data.
