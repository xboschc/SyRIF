RoB2 - 3.4 - Is it likely that missingness in the outcome depended on its true value? 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This question distinguishes between situations in which (i) missingness in the outcome could depend on its true value (assessed as ‘Some concerns’) from those in which (ii) it is likely that missingness in the outcome depended on its true value (assessed as ‘High risk of bias’). Five reasons for answering ‘Yes’ are: 

1. Differences between intervention groups in the proportions of missing outcome data. If there is a difference between the effects of the experimental and comparator interventions on the outcome, and the missingness in the outcome is influenced by its true value, then the proportions of missing outcome data are likely to differ between intervention groups. Such a difference suggests a risk of bias due to missing outcome data, because the trial result will be sensitive to missingness in the outcome being related to its true value. For time-to-event-data, the analogue is that rates of censoring (loss to follow-up) differ between the intervention groups. 

2. Reported reasons for missing outcome data provide evidence that missingness in the outcome depends on its true value; 

3. Reported reasons for missing outcome data differ between the intervention groups; 

4. The circumstances of the trial make it likely that missingness in the outcome depends on its true value. For example, in trials of interventions to treat schizophrenia it is widely understood that continuing symptoms make drop out more likely. 

5. In time-to-event analyses, participants’ follow up is censored when they stop or change their assigned intervention, for example because of drug toxicity or, in cancer trials, when participants switch to second-line chemotherapy. 

- Answer ‘No’ if the analysis accounted for participant characteristics that are likely to explain the relationship between missingness in the outcome and its true value.
