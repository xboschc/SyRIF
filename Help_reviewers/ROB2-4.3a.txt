RoB2 - 4.3a - Were outcome assessors aware that a trial was taking place?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This question applies to cluster-randomized trials in which participants report their outcomes themselves, for example in a questionnaire. If they are not aware that they are in a trial then their self-assessment cannot be affected by assignment even if they are aware of the intervention they received.
