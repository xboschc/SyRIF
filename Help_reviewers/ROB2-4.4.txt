RoB2 - 4.4 - Could assessment of the outcome have been influenced by knowledge of intervention received?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Knowledge of the assigned intervention could influence participant-reported outcomes (such as level of pain), observer-reported outcomes involving some judgement, and intervention provider decision outcomes. They are unlikely to influence observer-reported outcomes that do not involve judgement, for example all-cause mortality.
