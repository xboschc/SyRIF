RoB2 - 4.5 - Is it likely that assessment of the outcome was influenced by knowledge of intervention received? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This question distinguishes between situations in which (i) knowledge of intervention status could have influenced outcome assessment but there is no reason to believe that it did (assessed as ‘Some concerns’) from those in which (ii) knowledge of intervention status was likely to influence outcome assessment (assessed as ‘High’). When there are strong levels of belief in either beneficial or harmful effects of the intervention, it is more likely that the outcome was influenced by knowledge of the intervention received. Examples may include patient-reported symptoms in trials of homeopathy, or assessments of recovery of function by a physiotherapist who delivered the intervention.
