Is the numerical result being assessed likely to have been selected, on the basis of the results, from... 
RoB2 - 5.3 - ... multiple eligible analyses of the data? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A particular outcome measurement may be analysed in multiple ways. Examples include: unadjusted and adjusted models; final value vs change from baseline vs analysis of covariance; transformations of variables; different definitions of composite outcomes (e.g. ‘major adverse event’); conversion of continuously scaled outcome to categorical data with different cut-points; different sets of covariates for adjustment; and different strategies for dealing with missing data. Application of multiple methods generates multiple effect estimates for a specific outcome measurement. If multiple estimates are generated but only one or a subset is reported on the basis of the results (e.g. statistical significance), there is a high risk of bias in the fully reported result. Attention should be restricted to analyses that are eligible for consideration by the RoB 2 tool user. For example, if only the result from an analysis of post-intervention values is eligible for inclusion in a meta-analysis (e.g. at 12 weeks after randomization), and this is reported by the trial, then there would not be an issue of selection even if this result was reported (on the basis of the results) in preference to the result from an analysis of changes from baseline. 

- Answer ‘Yes’ or ‘Probably yes’ if: There is clear evidence (usually through examination of a trial protocol or statistical analysis plan) that a measurement was analysed in multiple eligible ways, but data for only one or a subset of analyses is fully reported (without justification), and the fully reported result is likely to have been selected on the basis of the results. Selection on the basis of the results arises from a desire for findings to be newsworthy, sufficiently noteworthy to merit publication, or to confirm a prior hypothesis. For example, trialists who have a preconception or vested interest in showing that an experimental intervention is beneficial may be inclined to selectively report analyses that are favourable to the experimental intervention. 

- Answer ‘No’ or ‘Probably no’ if: 
---There is clear evidence (usually through examination of a trial protocol or statistical analysis plan) that all eligible reported results for the outcome measurement correspond to all intended analyses. 
-or 
---There is only one possible way in which the outcome measurement can be analysed (hence there is no opportunity to select from multiple analyses). 
-or
---Analyses are inconsistent across different reports on the same trial, but the trialists have provided the reason for the inconsistency and it is not related to the nature of the results. 

- Answer ‘No information’ if: 
Analysis intentions are not available, or the analysis intentions are not reported in sufficient detail to enable an assessment, and there is more than one way in which the outcome measurement could have been analysed.
