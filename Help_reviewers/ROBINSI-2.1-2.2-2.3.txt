ROBINS I - 2.1 - Was selection of participants into the study (or into the analysis) based on participant characteristics observed after the start of intervention?
2.2 - If Y/PY to 2.1: Were the post-intervention variables that influenced selection likely to be associated with intervention?
2.3 - If Y/PY to 2.2: Were the post-intervention variables that influenced selection likely to be influenced by the outcome or a cause of the outcome?

This domain is concerned only with selection into the study based on participant characteristics observed after the start of intervention. Selection based on characteristics observed before the start of intervention can be addressed by controlling for imbalances between experimental intervention and comparator groups in baseline characteristics that are prognostic for the outcome (baseline confounding).

Selection bias occurs when selection is related to an effect of either intervention or a cause of intervention and an effect of either the outcome or a cause of the outcome. Therefore, the result is at risk of selection bias if selection into the study is related to both the intervention and the outcome.
