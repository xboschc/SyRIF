ROBINS I - 2.5 - Were adjustment techniques used that are likely to correct for the presence of selection biases?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is in principle possible to correct for selection biases, for example by using inverse probability weights to create a pseudo-population in which the selection bias has been removed, or by modelling the distributions of the missing participants or follow up times and outcome events and including them using missing data methodology. However such methods are rarely used and the answer to this question will usually be “No”.
