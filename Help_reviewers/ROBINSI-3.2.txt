ROBINS I - 3.2 - Was the information used to define intervention groups recorded at the start of the intervention?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In general, if information about interventions received is available from sources that could not have been affected by subsequent outcomes, then differential misclassification of intervention status is unlikely. Collection of the information at the time of the intervention makes it easier to avoid such misclassification. For population-level interventions (e.g. measures to control air pollution), the answer to this question is likely to be ‘Yes’.
