ROBINS I - 5.1 - Were outcome data available for all, or nearly all, participants?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“Nearly all” should be interpreted as “enough to be confident of the findings”, and a suitable proportion depends on the context. In some situations, availability of data from 95% (or possibly 90%) of the participants may be sufficient, providing that events of interest are reasonably common in both intervention groups. One aspect of this is that review authors would ideally try and locate an analysis plan for the study.
