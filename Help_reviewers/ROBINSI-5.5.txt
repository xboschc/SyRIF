ROBINS I - 5.5 - Is there evidence that results were robust to the presence of missing data?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Evidence for robustness may come from how missing data were handled in the analysis and whether sensitivity analyses were performed by the investigators, or
occasionally from additional analyses performed by the systematic reviewers. It is important to assess whether assumptions employed in analyses are clear and plausible. Both content knowledge and statistical expertise will often be required for this. For instance, use of a statistical method such as multiple imputation does not guarantee an appropriate answer. Review authors should seek na√Øve (complete-case) analyses for comparison, and clear differences between complete-case and multiple imputation-based findings should lead to careful assessment of the validity of the methods used.
