ROBINS I - 6.2 - Were outcome assessors aware of the intervention received by study participants?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

outcome assessors were blinded to intervention status, the answer to this question would be ‘No’. In other situations, outcome assessors may be unaware of the interventions being received by participants despite there being no active blinding by the study investigators; the answer this question would then also be ‘No’.

In studies where participants report their outcomes themselves, for example in a questionnaire, the outcome assessor is the study participant. In an observational study, the answer to this question will usually be ‘Yes’ when the participants report their outcomes themselves.
