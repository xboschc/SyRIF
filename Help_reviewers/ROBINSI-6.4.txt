ROBINS I - 6.4 - Were any systematic errors in measurement of the outcome related to intervention received?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This question refers to differential misclassification of outcomes. Systematic errors in measuring the outcome, if present, could cause bias if they are related to intervention or to a confounder of the intervention-outcome relationship. This will usually be due either to outcome assessors being aware of the intervention received or to non-comparability of outcome assessment methods, but there are examples of differential misclassification arising despite these controls being in place.
